# AI_Projects
This repository contains 2 projects from the course CS-GY-6613 Artificial Intelligence.

Project 1 
Problem Statement -> Given the sensor measurement in the form of orientation values, angular velocity and linear acceleration values on different surfaces. Train machine learning model to predict the surface for separately given test data.

Project 2
Problem Statement -> Continual learning for robotic perception.

Both notebooks contain detailed explaination of the approach.
